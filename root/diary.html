<h1>Dear Diary</h1>
   
    <p class="intro">
    Some days, everything aligns into greatness. And on some days, you just can't win! Here are two recent examples.

    The Best Day Ever!
    </h2>

    <p class="best">
    I was contacted by a spirit who said their name was "Father Yod". It was an amazing morning I won't forget. 
    </p>

    <p class="best">
    First, I want to say this happened.  I'm not making it up.  I was drinking some tea in my kitchen and was taking a sip, when this piercing green light flooded my kitchen.  I dropped my cup and I don't remember hearing it break.  This wooly silence was in the room and it was bright green.  Then a face materialized out of the color and it was a smiling older man.  He was laughing and I didn't fear him at all.  His lips were moving, but I couldn't hear him.  I mumbled "I can't hear you." And he cleared his throat and then it came though clearly, "sorry, I haven't visited anyone in a long time.  My name is Father Yod.  I am here to, if you want, take away your fear.  Do you want me to?"

    The Worst Day Ever!
    </h2>

    <p class="worst">
    I ran out of half-and-half.  I mean, NO half-and-half.  
    </p>
   
    <p class="worst">
    Following the crazy event of a couple weeks back, after which I didn't go to work and laid about in a stupor, I thought I had experienced weird stuff.  But then I learned that my roommate Kevin drank the last of the half-and-half and didn't replace it!  He knows how much I need it for my coffee.  We had that talk several times.  Now I can't even think about Father Yod.  And I stubbed my toe really bad on Kevin's stupid sculpture.  Which made the day even worse.
